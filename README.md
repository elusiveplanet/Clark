# Clark
Clark is (or more so, will be) an autonomous robot running using ROS. Clark uses a variety of sensors to determine his position, including an Xbox 360 Kinect, a 9-axis IMU, and various other feedback sources. Clark is driven by a 6 wheel West Coast drop center drive, giving him superb traction on most surfaces and the ability to turn in place.
